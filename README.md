# Civic Tech Playbook

What makes your project successful? What is your team's process and how can we
share what is working and what's not? Civic Tech projects are often volunteer
based. How do you manage a project where your team has limited time and
resources?

We're not trying to reinvent the wheel here. Folks are running successful civic
tech and volunteer projects today, so let's just write down what they're doing in
a way that new projects can follow along.
