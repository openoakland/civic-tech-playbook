# Contributing

Welcome! Thank you for considering a contribution to our project.  We are
a project of [OpenOakland](https://www.openoakland.org/), a team of volunteers,
part of the [Brigade Network](https://brigade.codeforamerica.org/) under [Code
for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org).

If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request
anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change
something. We love all friendly contributions.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its
[LICENSE](./LICENSE.md), and its [README](./README.md).
